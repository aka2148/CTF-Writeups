Yeah so I wanted to do mainly crypto, web and some osint but I have lab endsem on Mon,Tue, and Wed unfortunately so basically didn't have time to do much on sunday at all.
Web questions were fine, didn't get tiny flag and the notes app one i tried for like 10 minutes, was some jinja injection quesion where you had to url encode. Didn't finish
Crypto was very gptable, again I did my best to solve but had to focus more on my lab endsems
