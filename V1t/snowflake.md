# Question 
Snowflake

## Description
My friend sent me this picture, the snowflakes are so beautiful. Can you figure out where is this?

## Solution
I upsolved this not too long after the ctf ended, I had been solving this before and was very close.
Gave yandex the initial image and it helped point me to hokkaido.  
My main time waste came from the fact that I was very sure it was the hakodate region, the architecture looked way more similar than sapporo.

These numbers were my main source of info.  
The white stickers indicate its hokkaido electric company which was another indicator of it being hokkaido.  
I spent some time going through google earth looking for poles that started with 73 in hokkaido but that was predominantly in the 60's.  
Then I found a great document online: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16lVvh3sLCnHLh_itpEsvXrHHCR_EPzArBmb4bg6TUTU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.nf8f2k247j6q  
Full guide on japanese utility poles with an attatched youtube video, the top two numbers indicate location and that helped me  find out it was Sapporo.  
After some digging around in Sapporo and some hints in the osint channel i found the coordinates
