# Road Not Taked

## OSINT

### Solution
Started off by reverse image searching and giving gpt some images which gave me Ghana.
Confirmed this through the black tape on the camera mount of the car.

Used this to narrow down region. There was sufficient greenery but some shrubs as well. Enough to discount both coastal and savannah regions.
Most Likely was Transitional region.

From there my strategy was divided in two parts:
-Look for the same taped car
-Discard roads with no lines

Looking at the condition and type of road line allowed me to skip decent chunks of a road as the actual image had solid white line with the left and middle lines being highly worn out.

Eventually found the right road and just kept clicking on google earth till I found the location.

Found out about this later but this existed and would've made my life a lot easier lmao.
