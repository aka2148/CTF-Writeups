# Road Not Taked

## OSINT

### Solution
Started off by reverse image searching and giving gpt some images which gave me Ghana.
Confirmed this through the black tape on the camera mount of the car.  

<img width="519" height="779" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c37f5f0-da01-4fa0-ac3a-ab6b590e3b0d" />


Used this to narrow down region.
Most Likely was Transitional region.

From there my strategy was divided in two parts:
-Look for the same taped car
-Discard roads with no lines

Looking at the condition and type of road line allowed me to skip decent chunks of a road as the actual image had solid white line with the left and middle lines being highly worn out.

Eventually found the right road and just kept clicking on google earth till I found the location.
